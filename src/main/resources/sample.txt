Welcome to the Enhanced LSP4J Demo!

This is a sample text file that demonstrates the text file reading capability of the improved LauncherApp.

Features demonstrated:
- JSON client requests to the server
- Text file reading and content retrieval
- Message posting and fetching
- Structured JSON communication

The server can now:
1. Load and serve text file content
2. Handle multiple types of JSON requests
3. Manage user messages with proper JSON serialization
4. Provide error handling and logging

This text file contains exactly what you need to test the enhanced LSP4J application.
